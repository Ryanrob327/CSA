## Blog

My blog setup was relatively easy, I got my site up and deployed without any hiccups. However, things got a little more challenging with changing the theme, because none of the themes fit nicely, so I had to edit the CSS and recreate the header to look clean. Furthermore, I noticed that Mr. Mortensen had trouble getting the favicon to work, so I figured out a solution to the problem he was having by adding the site.baseurl to the icon file location.


## Java

Creating the Java jupyter notebook was also simple because I already know java pretty well from robotics. The only thing I have trouble with is installing the Java kernel for jupyter notebook, I have tried installing IJava and Beakerx.
