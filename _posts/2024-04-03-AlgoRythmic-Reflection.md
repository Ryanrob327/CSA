The event was fun, my favorite show was the bubble sort/bachelorette show because their jokes were funny. Though I do firmly believe that my show was the best with great acting and a wonderful script. Because although the Bachelorette did have funny jokes, our show told a story: The heroing story of a detective solving a crime case to catch a killer wanted for the murder of an entire party. Regardless of my feelings, I still had a fun time watching other shows and learning the ins and outs of different sorting algorithms.
