# Challenges

- The biggest challenge I ran into when taking this test was staying focused. One reason why is that I simply was not in a work conducive environment the entire time. But also the test feels very monotonous and it is difficult to focus the entire time with the amount that I need to be attentive. Thi lack of focus lead to several simple mistakes that I made.
- Another big challenge was College Board's trickery on some questions like the containsArt question where the answer was contained in a trick of wording, but in order to solve this problem I had to write out the code from the question into my IDE to find a solution.

# Learnings

- I learned how my environment can affect my focus 
- I learned java methods like String.substring() and Array.set()
- I learned that writing out the code from the question can sometimes help me understand the context and the details of the code in question.

# Improvement Plan

- Next test I take will ideally be in only one or two sittings and only in a place where it is quiet with no distractions.
- Need more practice with java OOP, some obscure topics like the "interface" object were new to me.
- Generally, more practice with these questions to improve my speed, because I took way too long completing this assignment.
